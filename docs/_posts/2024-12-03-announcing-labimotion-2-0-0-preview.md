Dear Chemotion LabIMotion users,

Welcome to the preview for Chemotion LabIMotion 2.0.0!

This is a major milestone for LabIMotion as we are upgrading to the latest version of react-bootstrap, which is the main library for UI components. This upgrade brings us a more modern and feature-rich UI experience.

With the new version of react-bootstrap and feedback from the community, we've also introduced new features to enhance the user experience. Let's jump into the details!

## Introducing the new UI experience

### Designer's New Form Layout

Based on community feedback, we have redesigned the form layout with a more general style to make it easier for users to get started.

{: .mt-0 }

### Arranging the order

Drag-and-drop is a highly interactive and user-friendly feature. We use drag-and-drop to perform reordering layers or fields for Designer, and the similar feature for User to rearrange the layers in the workspace. Reordering is great, but it's even better if the user can compare the original order at the same time. Therefore, we have provided a dedicated feature for ordering that allows you to visually compare the original order and the new order.

As a Designer, you can find functions to reorder layers or fields accordingly.

{: .mt-0 }

In user workspace (aka `MyDB`), you can find a button called `Arrange` on the toolbar and use it to rearrange layers.

## Workflow for Segment

In this version, we have introduced the workflow functionality to Segment. As a Designer, you can define a workflow in Segment template just like in Element template.

> [!NOTE]
> For more details about the workflow feature, please refer to the [Designer Guide](https://www.chemotion.net/docs/labimotion/guides/designer/workflow).

{: .mt-0 }

When you use a Segment that contains a predefined workflow, the workflow is automatically applied to the Segment and you can click the `Workflow (Predefined)` button to view the defined workflow.
